# Adyen_jpiqueras

### This is a temporal fork of the [adyen gem](https://github.com/wvanbergen/adyen)

The main difference is that implements the payout support by [AlexGaspar](https://github.com/AlexGaspar)

I also modified the ResponseError class to implement the new response error format (https://docs.adyen.com/developers/api-manual)
